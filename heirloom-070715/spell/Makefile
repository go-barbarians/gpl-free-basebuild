# Curses library. Change to -lncurses if necessary. Caution: Some gcc
# setups on Solaris are broken so that ncurses headers are used during

# usually lead to segmentation violations. The easiest fix is to write
# something like -L/path/to/ncurses/lib/directory -lncurses here.

# executables. The ps command will otherwise not be able to display any
# processes.
#
# On AIX 5.1, the system-supplied major(), minor(), and makedev() macros
# for accessing dev_t values are inappropriate if the compiler is used in
# 64-bit mode (by specifying -q64 or OBJECT_MODE=64 in the environment).
# Moreover, its 64-bit and 32-bit dev_t representations are incompatible.
# As a result, any programs that work with the contents of dev_t values
# will not give correct results in 64-bit mode; this affects at least
# cpio, mknod, pgrep, ps, tar, and whodo. Thus always use the 32-bit
# compiler mode (which is the default) until this issue is properly
# handled by the system vendor.

# On HP-UX B.11.11 on PA-RISC in 32-bit (default) mode, this was found
# not to work with fseeko(3), so disable it there unless you intend to
